# Trivy Operator — Vulnerability & Misconfiguration Scanning

[Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) scans the cluster continuously and
stores the results as Kubernetes objects: every workload's images are scanned for CVEs and
baked-in secrets, and workloads, Services, Ingresses, Roles etc. are checked for misconfigurations.
Summary counts are exported as Prometheus metrics and drawn by the **Trivy Security** Grafana
dashboard (<http://localhost:3000/d/trivy-security> via `./gke-port-forward.sh`). Every command below was run against the
live cluster.

## How it's installed

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Argo CD Application `trivy-operator` | `k8s/argocd/apps/trivy-operator.yaml` (sync wave -1) — upstream Helm chart `aqua/trivy-operator` **0.36.0** (operator v0.34.0, Trivy 0.74.0) |
| Chart values | `k8s/trivy-operator/trivy-operator-values.yaml`, pulled from `main` via a `$values` ref |
| Registration | the `root` Application (app of apps), like every other component |
| Metrics scrape | job `trivy-operator` in `k8s/observability/config/prometheus.yml` |
| Dashboard | `trivy-security.json` in `k8s/observability/grafana-dashboard-json-configmap.yaml` |

Everything runs in the `trivy-system` namespace (created by Argo, `CreateNamespace=true`): the
operator, the `trivy-server` StatefulSet, and the scan jobs, scheduled wherever there's room. The
`node-collector` job runs on each node it inspects.

Like every component here, Argo owns this chart end to end: bump `targetRevision` or edit the
values file, merge, and Argo rolls it out.

### Choices worth knowing

- **Trivy server mode** (`operator.builtInTrivyServer: true`). The `trivy-server-0` pod downloads
  the vulnerability DB once (onto its 5Gi PVC) and scan jobs query it, instead of every job pulling
  the ~80MB DB itself. Databases, all via `mirror.gcr.io`: `aquasec/trivy-db` (CVEs),
  `aquasec/trivy-java-db` (JAR → Maven mapping) and `aquasec/trivy-checks:1` (the Rego checks behind
  the misconfiguration/RBAC/compliance reports). Override them with `trivy.dbRegistry`/`dbRepository`,
  `trivy.javaDb*` and `policiesBundle.*` for a mirror.
- **`scanJobsConcurrentLimit: 3`** (chart default 10) so the first full-cluster pass doesn't starve
  the API pods on a 3-node cluster. That first pass takes a few minutes.
- **`excludeNamespaces: kube-system,gke-managed-system,gke-managed-cim,gmp-public`**: GKE's own
  images are noise (and not ours to fix). The cost is that `InfraAssessmentReports` for pods in
  `kube-system` are never produced (GKE's control plane isn't in the cluster anyway). Node checks still run as `ClusterInfraAssessmentReports`, but the operator exports no
  metric for them, so they're kubectl-only (below).
- **Default low-cardinality metrics.** The per-CVE-ID metric (`metricsVulnIdEnabled`) and the
  `*Info` metrics are off, so the dashboard shows counts, not CVE IDs. Use the reports for detail.
- **Not remote_written to OpenObserve.** The `trivy-operator` job is scraped by Prometheus only,
  not added to the `remote_write` keep list (see `PROMETHEUS.md` for the MemTable overflow history).
- **Kyverno** policies only cover `default`, `observability` and `headlamp`, so nothing in
  `trivy-system` needs an image allowlist entry or exception.

## Is it working? (start here)

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd trivy-operator      # Synced / Healthy
kubectl get pods -n trivy-system                        # trivy-operator + trivy-server-0 Running; scan-* / node-collector-* Completed
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -A --no-headers | wc -l   # grows during the first few minutes
```

In Prometheus (`kubectl port-forward -n observability svc/prometheus 9090:9090`, then
<http://localhost:9090/targets>) the `trivy-operator` target should be `UP`. It scrapes `trivy-operator.trivy-system.svc.cluster.local:8080`: the chart's
Service is headless, so its port-80 mapping never applies and the pod port is used directly.

## Reading the reports

```bash
# CVEs per container image (one report per workload container), with severity counts
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -n default -o wide

# The actual Critical/High CVEs in one report: severity, CVE, package, installed, fixed-in
kubectl get vulnerabilityreport -n default <report-name> -o json | jq -r \
  '.report.vulnerabilities[] | select(.severity=="CRITICAL" or .severity=="HIGH")
   | [.severity, .vulnerabilityID, .resource, .installedVersion, .fixedVersion] | @tsv'

# Secrets baked into image layers
kubectl get exposedsecretreports -A -o wide

# Misconfigurations per resource (workloads, Services, Ingresses, PVCs, ...)
kubectl get configauditreports -n default -o wide
kubectl get configauditreport -n default <report-name> -o json | jq -r \
  '.report.checks[] | select(.success==false) | [.severity, .checkID, .title] | @tsv'

# RBAC: which role a report is about, and its finding counts
kubectl get rbacassessmentreports -A -o custom-columns=NS:.metadata.namespace,REPORT:.metadata.name,ROLE:.metadata.labels.trivy-operator\\.resource\\.name,CRIT:.report.summary.criticalCount,HIGH:.report.summary.highCount
kubectl get clusterrbacassessmentreports

# Node checks (kubelet config, file permissions) - no metric, kubectl only
kubectl get clusterinfraassessmentreports -o wide

# Compliance specs: CIS 1.23, NSA 1.0, PSS baseline/restricted
kubectl get clustercompliancereports
```

Report names are `<kind>-<name>[-<container>]`, e.g.
`replicaset-message-service-<hash>-message-service`. Very long names are replaced by a hash
(`role-554cf6fccd`). The `trivy-operator.resource.*` labels on the report always hold the real
kind/name/namespace. Reports are re-created when the workload's pod template changes (new image
tag), and after `operator.scannerReportTTL` (24h), which picks up vulnerability DB updates.

To force a re-scan of one workload, delete its report: `kubectl delete vulnerabilityreport -n
<ns> <report-name>`.

## The dashboard

**Trivy Security** (`uid: trivy-security`). Filters: **Namespace** and **Severity**. The stat
tiles are fixed to one severity each, and the two tables always show all four severities as columns.

| Panel | Source metric |
| --- | --- |
| Critical / High / Medium / Low tiles | `trivy_image_vulnerabilities` (per workload container, so an image used by two workloads counts twice) |
| Exposed secrets | `trivy_image_exposedsecrets` |
| Failed config checks (Crit+High) | `trivy_resource_configaudits` |
| Vulnerabilities by namespace / over time | `trivy_image_vulnerabilities` by namespace/severity |
| Most vulnerable images | `max by (image)` of the above (deduped by image), plus a workload count |
| Misconfigurations by resource | `trivy_resource_configaudits` by resource |
| RBAC findings by severity | `trivy_role_rbacassessments` + `trivy_clusterrole_clusterrbacassessments` |
| Cluster compliance | `trivy_cluster_compliance` (Pass/Fail control counts per spec) |

**Cluster compliance shows 0 / 0** until the first scheduled run: specs are evaluated on
`compliance.cron` (chart default `0 */6 * * *`, UTC), not at install.

## Status and limits

- Counts only on the dashboard. Enabling `operator.metricsVulnIdEnabled` adds one series per CVE
  per workload (thousands here), which would need its own cardinality check.
- Findings don't block anything: Trivy reports, Kyverno enforces. Gating deploys on scan results
  (for example a Kyverno policy on `VulnerabilityReport` counts, or a Trivy step in CI) is not set up.
- No alerting rules yet. The metrics are there for an alert on new Critical CVEs.
