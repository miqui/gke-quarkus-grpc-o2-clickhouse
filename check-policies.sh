# Evaluates the Kyverno policies in k8s/policies/ against this repo's manifests - the same
# policies the cluster enforces, run before merge (CI: .github/workflows/policy-check.yml).
# Needs `kubectl` (for `kubectl kustomize`) and the `kyverno` CLI; run from anywhere.
#
#   1. ENFORCE set vs the `default` namespace manifests (k8s/)        -> must pass, fails the check
#   2. AUDIT set vs k8s/, k8s/observability/ and k8s/clickhouse/     -> reported, never fails
#   3. self-test: ENFORCE set vs a known-bad fixture                  -> must be rejected
#
# The enforce and audit sets are separate runs on purpose: the CLI exits 1 on any failure and
# `--audit-warn` doesn't distinguish Deny from Audit for the CEL policy types, so a single run
# can't express "enforce fails, audit warns". PolicyExceptions must also be passed separately
# (--exception) - in the same file as the policies the CLI silently loads nothing.
